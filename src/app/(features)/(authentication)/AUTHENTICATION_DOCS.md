### AUTHENTICATION

# `AuthContext`
`AuthContext` is the center of consuming, dispatching anything. We don't set states individually. Functions update `authObject` but it is important to not duplicate authObject, there should be only single auth object.

# AuthProvider
Before, using auth context, 
# FormProvider
# authObject
# authReducer
